Gesture Control Application
Overview
The Gesture Control Application is a Python-based tool that uses a webcam to recognize hand gestures and perform various system actions like controlling brightness, volume, and mouse movements. The application leverages MediaPipe for hand-tracking, PyAutoGUI for system interaction, and other libraries for seamless integration.
